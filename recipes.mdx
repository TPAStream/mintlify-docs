## How to create a test payer with some claims 


1. Using your credentials, log into the TPA Stream admin portal
2. Create a Test Employer with Test Payer(s)
    1. On the sidebar, select “Employers” 
    2. Create a new Employer called “Test Employer”
    3. Under “Carriers” on the newly created “Test Employer”, add Test Carrier and Test Two Factor Auth Carrier from the drop-down and Save Carrier.
    4. Under the “Support” tab of your “Test Employer”, click the “Lock” key to make changes
    5. Under “Internal Key” type “test-employer-key”
        1. If “Internal Key” does not show up, please contact [support@tpastream.com](mailto:support@tpastream.com)
3. Create an SDK Key
    6. On the “Settings” page, go to “Manage SDK Access”
    7. Generate a new token (or use an existing token if you already have one)
    8. Click “Save Changes”
4. Create a test Policy Holder using the SDK
    9. Initialize the SDK in your application using JavaScript using the Client Usage guide, using the test employer
        2. [https://github.com/TPAStream/stream-connect-js-sdk/blob/master/docs/client-usage.md#client-usage](https://github.com/TPAStream/stream-connect-js-sdk/blob/master/docs/client-usage.md#client-usage)
        3. To use the “Test Employer,” you’ll need to use the key created above

            ```json
            employer: {
                            systemKey: 'test-employer-key',
                            vendor: 'internal',
                            name: 'Test Employer'
                        },
            ```


    10. Load your application and select the “Test Carrier” or “Test Two Factor Auth Carrier”
    11. Enter a unique username and password (just make a very unique username and password combination up, it will validate)
        4. Hint:
            1. If you include the word “invalid” anywhere in the username (i.e. “invalidbob2135252”), it will test the flow for invalid credentials
            2. If you include the word “break” anywhere in the username (i.e. “breakme213252153232”), it will simulate an error where we were unable to validate the user’s credentials
            3. If you include the word “fast” anywhere in the username, it will validate the credentials really fast (useful for testing)
    12. Click “Submit Credentials” in your application
5. The Application will create about 5 claims with some random data, firing any Webhooks configured under “Manage Webhook Access” on the Settings page.
