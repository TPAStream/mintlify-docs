title: "Authentication"
description: "TPA Stream's REST API supports Basic Authentication over HTTPS using your Secret API Key."
---

To implement, simply put your user name (email address) and Secret API key in
the Authorization header on each API request.

**Your API key is a Secret Password! Do not share this key with anyone,
including TPA Stream. TPA Stream will NEVER ask for your Secret API Key.**

A simple example using curl:

```bash
curl -L --user me@example.com:MY_API_KEY https://app.tpastream.com/api/claims
```
