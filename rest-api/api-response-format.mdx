title: "API Response Format"
---

Each API endpoint, upon success, will return an object with the entity (or
entities) in the data key. If the endpoint is paginated, it will also contain a
number of other pagination related fields:

```json
{
  "data": [], // or {} for a single entity
  "has_next": true,
  "has_prev": false,
  "next_num": 2,
  "page": 1,
  "pages": 123,
  "per_page": 1000,
  "prev_num": 0,
  "total": 122901
}
```
