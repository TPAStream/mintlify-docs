title: "Generating a GPG Key"
---

To generate a GPG keypair:

1. Download and install the GPG command line tools for your operating system. We
   generally recommend installing the latest version for your operating system.
2. Open Terminal.
3. Generate a GPG key pair.

```
gpg --full-generate-key
```

4. At the prompt, specify the kind of key you want, or press Enter to accept the
   default.
5. At the prompt, specify the key size you want, or press Enter to accept the
   default. Your key must be at least 4096 bits.
6. Enter the length of time the key should be valid. Press Enter to specify the
   default selection, indicating that the key doesn’t expire.
7. Verify that your selections are correct
8. Enter your user ID information. Note: When asked to enter your email address,
   ensure that you enter the verified email address for your TPA Stream account.
9. Type a secure passphrase
10. Use the gpg `–list-secret-keys –keyid-format=long` command to list the long
    form of the GPG keys for which you have both a public and private key.
11. From the list of GPG keys, copy the long form of the GPG key ID you’d like
    to use. In this example, the GPG key ID is `3AA5C34371567BD2`:

```
$ gpg –list-secret-keys –keyid-format=long /Users/hubot/.gnupg/secring.gpg ———————————— sec 4096R/3AA5C34371567BD2 2016-03-10 [expires: 2017-03-10] uid Hubot ssb 4096R/42B317FD4BA89E7A 2016-03-10
```

12. Paste the text below, substituting in the GPG key ID you’d like to use. In
    this example, the GPG key ID is `3AA5C34371567BD2`

```
$ gpg --armor --export 3AA5C34371567BD2 # Prints the GPG key ID, in ASCII armor format
```

13. Copy your GPG key, beginning with `—–BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK—–` and
    ending with `—–END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK—–`
14. Add the GPG key to your TPA Stream account
