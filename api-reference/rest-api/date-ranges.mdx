title: "A Note About Date Ranges"
---

Types of data that are date ranges are serialized to JSON as an object with
bounds:

```json
{
  "bounds": "[)",
  "end": "2016-09-16",
  "start": "2016-09-15"
}
```

Note that since date of service can span over multiple days (for example, a
hospital stay), it is stored as a range.

_In the text form of a range, an inclusive lower bound is represented by “[”
while an exclusive lower bound is represented by “(”. Likewise, an inclusive
upper bound is represented by “]”, while an exclusive upper bound is represented
by “)”_
