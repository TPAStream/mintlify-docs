title: "Generating an SSH Key"
---

To generate an SSH keypair:

1. Open your Terminal (on Linux/Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
2. Paste the following command:

```
ssh-keygen
```

This creates a new SSH keypair.

    1. When you’re prompted to “Enter a file in which to save the key,” press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

    ```
    Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/algorithm): [Press enter]
    ```

    2. At the prompt, you may enter a secure passphrase. You can leave this blank.

    ```
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]

    Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
    ```
