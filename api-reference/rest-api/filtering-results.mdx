title: "Filtering and Paging Through Results"
---

Most API endpoints have enforced pagination. There are currently no globally
defined upper limits to how much can be requested per_page, but please try to
maintain a healthy balance between number of requests and amount of data
requested via per_page with each request. When pulling large amounts of data, we
recommend starting with per_page=1000 and optimizing as necessary. Please
contact [support@tpastream.com](mailto:support@tpastream.com) if you intend to
pull large amounts of data, as we can help define a strategy or custom endpoint
to better serve both your needs & ours.
