title: "API Errors"
---

In the event that there is an error, our response will have a key of message. It
may contain some other additional information depending on the nature of the
error. If the error is an unexpected error (and raises an exception in our
system), it will also contain an event_id. If you see an event_id, then our
engineers are notified that there is an issue.

We make every effort to provide meaningful HTTP status codes and messages when
there is an error. Please do not hesitate to contact us regarding your usage of
our API by emailing [support@tpastream.com](mailto:support@tpastream.com).

Error responses will look something like this:

```json
{
  "message": "There was an error and hopefully this is useful info.",
  "event_id": "xxxxxxxxxx"
}
```
