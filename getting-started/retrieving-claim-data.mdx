title: "Retrieving Claim Data"
---

Typically we begin receiving a participants claims within a minute or so after
they connect their account using our Client Library. It can take anywhere from
several minutes to several hours for us to receive all their claims, which are
usually ordered by newest claims first.

There are several ways for you to get Claim Data into your application. If you
want them as soon as possible, the quickest way to get them is by implementing
our [Connect Claim Webhook](tpa-stream-connect/webhooks/claim). You can also
pull claims on demand using our [REST API](). Additionally, we can setup a daily
CSV file feed to send all new claims via sFTP, FTPS, or to an S3 bucket. Contact
[sales@tpastream.com](mailto:sales@tpastream.com) to learn more.
