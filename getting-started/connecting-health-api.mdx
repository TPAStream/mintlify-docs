title: "Connecting the Health Insurance API to your Application"
---

In order to get Claim data into your application, a participant must first
connect their Health Insurance account with your application using TPA Streamâ€™s
API. The easiest way to accomplish this is by using our
[Connect Client Library](tpa-stream-connect/client-library/client-library).

Our Client Library is highly configurable and meant to be built directly into
your application. Once embedded into your application, the client will allow the
participant to select an Insurance Carrier from our list, enter their
credentials, and verify them in realtime. Once they are connected, we will start
receiving their Claim data asynchronously.
