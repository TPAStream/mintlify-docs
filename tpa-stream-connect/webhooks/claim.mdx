### Trigger

The claim webhook will fire whenever a new claim is processed in TPA Stream.

### Claim Webhook URL

To edit the claim webhook URL, click on “Account Settings” on the settings page.

Note that you will only see this setting if the claim webhook feature is
enabled.

Once the webhook URL has been updated, all future posts will go to that URL.

### Replaying a Claim Post

To manually replay a claim post, find the appropriate claim on the claims page
and click the “Replay webhook” button. If the button is not shown, please verify
that the webhook feature is enabled and a URL is set as described above. This
“replay” functionality is useful for testing, and can also be used to trigger a
webhook for any pre-existing claims that are in the system, if desired.
