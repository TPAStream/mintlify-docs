title: "Request Retries"
---

The request will be an HTTP POST with Content-Type header of application/json.
An example of the JSON you can expect can be found at the end of this document.
For Webhook POSTs, TPA Stream listens for the following codes from your server
and reacts accordingly:

- If TPA Stream receives a `200` or `2xx` (Success) code it will determine the
  webhook POST is successful and not retry.
- If TPA Stream receives a `406` (Not Acceptable) code, TPA Stream will
  determine the POST is rejected and not retry.
- For any other code, TPA Stream will retry POSTing with an exponential backoff
  delay for up to 4 hours.
