title: "First Crawl Completion Webhook"
description: "TPA Stream also offers a crawl webhook feature that posts details about the first crawl of a policyholder to a customer-provided endpoint."
---

Trigger The first crawl completion webhook will fire after all the claims for
the first crawl of a policyholder have been processed. If this crawl is
successful, that will be the last time the webhook fires for the policyholder.
If the crawl fails, the trigger will fire again on the next crawl. This will
occur until a crawl has successfully completed for the policyholder. For
example, if the first two crawls fail and the next two ones succeed, 3 POST
requests will be made. Two for the failures and a third, final POST for the
first success.

Note if you create a new member and associate it with an existing carrier login,
the system will not fire the webhook if that existing carrier login has already
had a successful first crawl. Even though the member is new, the system reuses
the existing carrier login (policyholder).

### First Crawl Completion Webhook URL

To edit the first crawl completion webhook URL, click on “Account Settings” on
the settings page similar to editing the claim webhook URL.

### Replaying a Crawl Completion Post

![](/images/first-crawl-completion.png)

To manually replay a first completion webhook post, find the appropriate member
on the member page. Under policy holders, there will be a button to replay the
webhook request. If the button is not shown, please verify that the webhook
feature is enabled and a URL is set as described above. This “replay”
functionality is useful for testing. If a crawl for that policy holder has not
happened yet, it will return a failure. Note that the replay will not have
crawl_claim_ids and will not be retried upon failure.
