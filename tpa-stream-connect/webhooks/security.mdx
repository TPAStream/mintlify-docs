### TPAStream-Signature Verification

Also included in the request is a JWT signature that can be used to verify that
the request has originated from TPA Stream, and not any other party. This header
is passed in the TPAStream-Signature header of the request. The signature can be
verified using our SSH RSA public key. The key can be obtained from
[TPA Stream Keys](https://app.tpastream.com/keys). The JWT hashing algorithm
used is RS256.

We strongly recommend that you verify our JWT signature as a part of your
webhook. Examples of how to decode a JWT in several common programming languages
can be found at [JWT library](https://jwt.io). Note that the JWT library you
choose must support RS256 (nearly all of them do), and should also support an
exp check (although you could easily perform this simple expiration date check
yourself using a UTC timestamp).
