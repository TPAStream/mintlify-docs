As of SDK version 0.4.7 the CDN provider is now versioned and will support up to
10 minor versions behind.

- Importing the various versions of the SDK is handled in `src` attribute on
  your script tag
  - `https://app.tpastream.com/static/js/sdk.js` Grabs the latest version of the
    SDK
  - `https://app.tpastream.com/static/js/sdk-v-<VersionNumber>.js` For a
    specific version. Examples below.
    - `https://app.tpastream.com/static/js/sdk-v-0.4.7.js`

### SDK Client Usage Docs

We highly suggest taking a look at our
[Detailed Client-Usage Docs](https://github.com/TPAStream/stream-connect-js-sdk/blob/master/docs/client-usage.md#client-usage)
on github while attempting to implement the SDK.

There you will find explanations for all of the various callbacks in the example
above as well as explanations for the various configuration paramters.
